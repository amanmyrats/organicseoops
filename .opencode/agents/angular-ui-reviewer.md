Read and follow `AGENTS.md`, then `.agents/roles/angular-ui-reviewer.md`, using paths relative to the repository root. Load the context required by that role and return its review report only.

Apply `AGENTS.md` Reviewer file access and Verification cadence through the shared role; native tool permissions remain authoritative.
